# Linked Lists Overview

This document provides an overview of the three primary types of linked lists: single linked lists, doubly linked lists, and circular linked lists.

## Single Linked List

In a single linked list, each element (known as a node) contains:

- **Data**: The value or data represented by the node.
- **Next Pointer**: A reference to the next node in the list.

Traversal in a single linked list is forward-only, starting from the head (the first node) and following the 'next' pointers to each subsequent node.

### Characteristics
- Each node points to the next node in the list.
- The last node points to `null`, indicating the end of the list.
- Efficient for operations like insertion and deletion.

## Doubly Linked List

A doubly linked list is an extension of the single linked list where each node contains:

- **Data**: The value or data represented by the node.
- **Next Pointer**: A reference to the next node in the list.
- **Previous Pointer**: A reference to the previous node in the list.

This structure allows for traversal both forwards and backwards through the list.

### Characteristics
- Navigation is possible in both directions.
- Each node keeps a reference to both the next and the previous node.
- More memory-intensive due to the extra pointer.

## Circular Linked List

A circular linked list is a variation of the linked list where the last node points back to the first node, forming a circle. It can be a variation of either a single or a doubly linked list.

### Circular Single Linked List
- Similar to a single linked list but the last node points to the first node instead of `null`.

### Circular Doubly Linked List
- Similar to a doubly linked list but the list forms a continuous loop, with the last node pointing to the first node and vice versa.

### Characteristics
- There is no null at the end; the list loops back to the start.
- Useful for applications that require continuous looping over a list.

## Conclusion

Each type of linked list offers unique advantages and is suited for different scenarios. Understanding these variations is crucial for selecting the appropriate data structure for your needs.
